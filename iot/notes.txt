Instructions for running:

- enable SPI on pi
- ensure sense_hat and gpiozero installed (they are automatically installed on the Pi)
- moisture sensor calibration is unlikely to be needed as long as wires are not loose

Make the script run on startup:
Inside /etc/rc.local, add the folowing line before it exits:
    python3 /home/pi/smart_plant.py --upload=True -s 1800 &

AUTO CONFIGURATION OF CLOUD: (i.e. if SSH/Pi access is not available to setup cloud details):
- turn off Pi, remove microSD card, insert into another machine using a card reader
- add a plant.config file in the /boot partition on the Pi's SD card 
- copy paste the following into this file and save it, replacing ID and PASSWORD with your plant ID and password
{"plant_id": "ID", "plant_key": "PASSWORD"}
